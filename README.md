# Getting Set up
1. Clone this repo. Copying the link from the 'Clone or Download' button above and pasting it after the command 'git clone' on Terminal should be all you need to do for this step. 

2. 'npm install' and you should see a few packages install. 

3. 'npm start' will start running the server locally on port 3000. A mongod process will also need to be running on port 27017.

4. Navigating to localhost:3000 will allow you to interact with the app locally.
